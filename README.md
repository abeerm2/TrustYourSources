# TrustYourSources
Everyday, millions of individuals around the world rely on multinational, media conglomerates to provide them with reliable updates of current events. We as the people trust we are being given non bias news that helps us develop our own opinions and views about the given topic, but to what degree should we trust these sources? TrustYourSources was designed to help bring knowledge to the people and to see if topics in the news share the same sentiments as real people on social media. 

## What it does
TrustYourSources lets you search up current topics and compare the sentiment of the topic in the media vs. how social media feels about it. Since we all know the media is never un-biased, TrustYourSources was designed in order to help you as an individual learn if certain media sources create articles that agree or oppose with the general public.

## How to use it
See trending topics in the news or trending topics in social media, or search up your own keywords!
Filter results by social media apps and/or media sources to get a comprehensive understanding of how certain apps or media companies differ!
